# Getting Started
* Testing Service  
  * Most of the APIs will be hosted over at https://bastionmc.epizy.com/mcapi/{apifilenamehere}.php  
  * You can make your _POST_ or _GET_ requests as usual.  
  * The examples for the different APIs would be instructing you on how to use the testing service.  
  * Everyone is allowed to use this service in their projects, but please be mindful so as to not use up too much network resources.
